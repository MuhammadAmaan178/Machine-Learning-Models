Linear Regression Model for Sales Prediction
This project uses a Linear Regression model to predict sales based on advertising budgets for TV, Radio, and Newspaper.

Dataset
The dataset consists of four columns:
TV: TV ad budget (in thousands of dollars)
Radio: Radio ad budget (in thousands of dollars)
Newspaper: Newspaper ad budget (in thousands of dollars)
Sales: Sales (units sold)

Model
The model is built using Python and the scikit-learn library. It predicts sales based on the three advertising budgets.
