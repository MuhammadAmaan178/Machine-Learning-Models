Random Forest Classifier
This repository contains an implementation of a Random Forest Classifier. The model is designed to perform supervised learning tasks, particularly classification, by utilizing an ensemble of decision trees to make predictions.

Features:
Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
Random Forest Classifier implementation using [insert library, e.g., scikit-learn].
Hyperparameter tuning for optimizing model performance.
Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Usage:
Prepare your dataset.
Train the model using the provided script.
Evaluate the model's performance with the built-in evaluation functions.
Feel free to modify the code for your specific dataset or problem!
