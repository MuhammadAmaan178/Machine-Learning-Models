Decision Tree Classifier
This repository contains an implementation of the Decision Tree Classifier, a popular machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks. The model splits data into subsets based on feature values, forming a tree-like structure to make predictions.

Features:
Train a Decision Tree classifier on labeled data
Evaluate model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, etc.
Visualize the decision tree structure
Built using Python and popular libraries like scikit-learn
